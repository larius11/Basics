All skeleton programs I decide to build.

##FizzBuzz

Came across a reddit post in r/programming that described FizzBuzz as an interview question. It's simple really.

	1.) Start outputting numbers from 1 to 100 in increments of 1. 
	2.) Every number that is a multiple of 3 must be replaced by "Fizz". 
	3.) Every number that is a multiple of 5 must be replaced by "Buzz". 
	4.) Every number that is a multiple of both must be replaced by "FizzBuzz".

The exercise is supposed to show how an individual approaches programming in a general sense. 
	i.e. How they decide to tackel the problem based on their skillset.


I will be programming FizzBuzz and putting it up to my GitHub to leave a record of my current programming level and may revise it in the future.
