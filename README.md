# Basics

All skeleton programs I decide to build will live here.

## 1 - FizzBuzz

Came across a reddit post in **r/programming** that described FizzBuzz as an interview question. It's simple really.

	1.) Start outputting numbers from 1 to 100 in increments of 1. 
	2.) Every number that is a multiple of 3 must be replaced by "Fizz". 
	3.) Every number that is a multiple of 5 must be replaced by "Buzz". 
	4.) Every number that is a multiple of both must be replaced by "FizzBuzz".

The exercise is supposed to show how an individual approaches programming in a general sense.  i.e. How they decide to tackle the problem based on their skillset.


I will be programming FizzBuzz and putting it up to my GitHub to leave a record of my current programming level and may revise it in the future.

Here's the link to the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc&feature=youtu.be) that inspired me.

Written originally in C. Looking to re-write it for Java, Python, and C++.

## 2 - Calculator

This project is an extremely basic interactive calculator program written in C that can Add/Subtract/Multiply for now. The plan is to implement division as well as basic equation solving capabilities. 

TO-DO's:
	* Check for invalid input on the numbers.
	* Clean up the user interaction to allow for equation typing instead of operand then numbers.
	* Clean up switch statement with different functions and capabilities.
